# The Weekly Python 3 Challenge

I haven't done Python in a while. I am going to challenge myself each week to write a program to accomplish a certain task. I started off with daily challenges, but I realized rather quickly that I don't have that kind of time.

Challenges:
* (2/13/2023 - 2/17/2023): Command-line Calculator
